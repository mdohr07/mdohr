Continuing with my yearly review, today’s topic is music. I always enjoy checking out Spotify’s annual recap, and this time, I’d like to share and document what stood out for me in 2024.

## January

Honestly, I would’ve called it my Retro Pop phase. I curated a playlist of 80s hits and later mixed in some retro-inspired tracks, including a few from The Weeknd.

## February

This aligns more with what I "usually" listen to, but then there was a plot twist...

## September

When my retraining program started, I needed music to code with—something that wouldn’t distract me. Tracks with lyrics were generally a no-go. That’s when I discovered this genre, fell in love with it, and began building a playlist. Starting from scratch wasn’t easy since I had no idea what to look for, but the list keeps growing. I’ve titled it “Pew Pew Spaceships”!

## Recap
It seems like not much changed with my music routine between these months because they’re the only three Spotify highlighted for me. But there’s still the matter of my Top Artists and Top Songs.

Ah yes, Shania Twain made an appearance. I used to have such a crush on her, and after watching the Shania documentary with my wife this year, I felt like listening to her again. Apparently, I listened to Battle Beast the most, even receiving a fan message from the band. While I wouldn’t call myself a fan (I don’t even know the band members’ names), I’ll still say, “Thanks!”

<img src="https://mdohr.space/src/img/assets/blog/2024-music/top-songs.png" alt="Your Top Songs: 1. The Weeknd - Blinding Lights, 2. The Weeknd - Starboy, 3. Guns N' Roses - Sweet Child O' Mine, 4. Battle Beast - Eye Of The Storm, 5. Gloryhammer - Fly Away">
I’m surprised by the third spot, but hey, if Spotify says so, it must be true! None of my "Pew Pew Spaceships" tracks made it here, likely because the playlist contains such a wide variety of songs and artists that I always played on shuffle.

Before wrapping up, here’s the linked version of my top tracks for 2024:
